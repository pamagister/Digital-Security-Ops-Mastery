# Setting up a child-proof phone
The aim of this chapter is to set up a mobile phone that can be used safely by children.
The focus is on ensuring the following features:
- Limiting the screen time for certain apps and categories of apps
- Preventing the installation and uninstallation of certain apps
- Preventing the uninstallation of the app required to limit screen time
- Protection against inappropriate content
- Localization of the phone in case of loss or to determine the location of the child

## Set up device

### Set up scree time limit
To set up the screen time limit, individual apps can be grouped into categories using the app mentioned above.
An individual time limit can be set for each of these categories.

One problem is that the display time limit is more of a self-control mechanism. Although a pin can be set up, it is very easy to bypass.

### Set up App locker
To prevent the above-mentioned app from being deactivated or even uninstalled, App Lock can be used to set up an access lock for certain apps.

The settings menu can also be secured via this app to prevent the lock app from being uninstalled. A recovery email must be set up for this.

It can also be used to protect harmless apps that require a special configuration (e.g. nextcloud) that should not be changed by the child.
